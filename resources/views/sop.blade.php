                        <p class="card-text">
                            Preparation before visiting Goa Jomblang is crucial, as many caving participants come without knowing much about caving activities or the environmental conditions in the cave. As discussed in a previous article about caving at Goa Jomblang, this section will focus more on the necessary items to bring before starting the journey, ensuring that you pack efficiently. These include:
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Clothing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear simple, easy-to-clean clothes, such as shorts and a t-shirt.</li>
                            <li>The trail inside the cave can be quite muddy, especially during the rainy season, with mud depths varying between 1-5 cm. Itâ€™s highly recommended to bring a change of clothes.</li>
                            <li>Footwear is included in the Goa Jomblang trip package, so you only need to bring your own shoes or sandals. However, if you prefer to use your own shoes, be prepared for them to get dirty or damaged by mud and rocks.</li>
                            <li>It is not advisable to wear excessive clothing, such as gowns or easily torn shorts, as descending with a body harness requires the body to be securely tied with ropes. Excessive clothing could interfere with the safety equipment and the caving experience.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Socks</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Socks are optional but recommended to enhance comfort. The boots provided by Goa Jomblang's management come in limited sizes. For example, if your shoe size is 25 cm and all boots of that size are already in use, you may have to wear larger boots, which could cause blisters. Wearing socks can help prevent discomfort or injury.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Camera</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Capturing the breathtaking scenery inside and outside the cave is invaluable. While professional photographers are available at Goa Jomblang, they can only take pictures of participants outside the cave, and the photos are sold as printed copies.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Flashlight</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            The path leading to the "light of heaven" is very dark, so a flashlight is necessary for walking safely. Although the cave guides carry flashlights, bringing your own is also a good idea.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Insect Repellent</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            If you are uncomfortable with mosquito bites, consider bringing insect repellent. The area outside the cave is a forest, which is a natural habitat for mosquitoes.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Drinking Water</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            For those who are not used to physical activity, this trip can be quite exhausting due to the challenging terrain, including steep climbs, descents, slippery paths, and rocky areas. The duration of the trip is also considerable, so bringing bottled water is essential.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Small Backpack</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            A small backpack is useful for carrying your personal items, such as a camera, bottled water, flashlight, and any trash, such as empty water bottles, that you may generate during the trip.
